            About Me
        </h2>
        <p>
            Thank you for visiting my website. My name is <strong>Charlie Sanchez</strong>, and I am a junior at the <em>Wake Early College of Information and Biotechnologies</em>. 
            My path of study is computer programming/IT in general, which I enjoy but do not plan to pursue in the future. I have learned about <strong>networking, 
            Python, and web design</strong> alongside other skills. I used to have interest in computer forensics, but have shifted interest from there. This school
            provides an incredible community, and I enjoy working with my peers. It has allowed me to explore the IT field, something I wouldn't have delved
            into if not for this school. There is also a strong emphasis on <strong>college and career readiness</strong>, my classes aiding me in developing useful soft 
            skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            Shifting away from school, I have a <em>lot</em> of interests and passions I pursue in my free time. I am extremely passionate about the arts - I love
            acting, dancing, singing, writing, music, and visual art. Many of these interests bleed into my persona at school - <strong>I am the president of the
            drama department and I am a strong competitor on our debate team</strong>. I am also a member of the game development club, fusing my technical skills 
            with my love for art and design. My creativity and desire to innovate motivates me to become an engineer - notably, a nuclear engineer. Nuclear 
            energy is a topic I just recently discovered, but have fallen in love with. Developing a completely clean energy source like <strong>nuclear fusion</strong> is 
            one of my main goals in life. Powering an entire world and reducing the fear around nuclear is something I would love to achieve.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also want to keep pursuing my artistic interests in the future. I want to become a somewhat recognized actress, a musician (I'm currently
            learning the guitar, but I would love to learn the harpsichord and accordion!), and an artist. I also <em>really</em> want to live in Germany, so I've 
            been learning German these past few months. It is such a beautiful language... I am planning to go to a <strong>four-year college</strong> after high school, 
            and I may even chase a master's degree afterwards. I will probably stay local until I secure an overseas job, which will hopefully be soon
            after I graduate college!

            My Best Projects!
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Fukushima Comic</strong>
                <br> Created for Earth Science, I wrote and drew a comic telling the story of the Fukushima Daichii disaster, and also explained the reason behind it. 
                It was a <em>managerial</em> issue, the energy was <strong>not</strong> to blame.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong><em>LocalReach</em></strong>
                <br> My group's submission in the <em>Ready, Set, App!</em> competition, LocalReach is an app for small businesses to use as a forum and a place to 
                gather customer feedback. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Women PBL</strong>
                <br><em>Also</em> created for a schoolwide competition, I developed a presentation detailing the risks women working in healthcare face daily. I came
                in second place by a <strong>0.1</strong> margin!
