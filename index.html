            About Me
        </h2>
        <p>
            Thank you for visiting my website. My name is <strong>Charlie Sanchez</strong>, and I am a junior at the <em>Wake Early College of Information and Biotechnologies</em>. 
            My path of study is computer programming/IT in general, which I enjoy but do not plan to pursue in the future. I have learned about <strong>networking, 
            Python, and web design</strong> alongside other skills. I used to have interest in computer forensics, but have shifted interest from there. This school
            provides an incredible community, and I enjoy working with my peers. It has allowed me to explore the IT field, something I wouldn't have delved
            into if not for this school. There is also a strong emphasis on <strong>college and career readiness</strong>, my classes aiding me in developing useful soft 
            skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            Shifting away from school, I have a lot of interests and passions I pursue in my free time. I am extremely passionate about the arts - I love
            acting, dancing, singing, writing, music, and visual art. Many of these interests bleed into my persona at school - I am the president of the
            drama department and I am a strong competitor on our debate team. I am also a member of the game development club, fusing my technical skills 
            with my love for art and design. My creativity and desire to innovate motivates me to become an engineer - notably, a nuclear engineer. Nuclear 
            energy is a topic I just recently discovered, but have fallen in love with. Developing a completely clean energy source like nuclear fusion is 
            one of my main goals in life. Powering an entire world and reducing the fear around nuclear is something I would love to achieve.
        </p>

            I also want to keep pursuing my artistic interests in the future. I want to become a somewhat recognized actress, a musician (I'm currently
            learning the guitar, but I would love to learn the harpsichord and accordion!), and an artist. I also really want to live in Germany, so I've 
            been learning German these past few months. It is such a beautiful language... I am planning to go to a four-year college after high school, 
            and I may even chase a master's degree afterwards. I will probably stay local until I secure an overseas job, which will hopefully be soon
            after I graduate college!
