<h3>Hobbies</h3>

        <strong>Acting</strong>
        I've loved and participated in acting and theater since middle school. Not only is performing tons of fun, but it is also <em>extremely</em> rewarding.
        Really stepping into a character's shoes and making them come to life is incredible.

        <strong>Writing</strong>
        Ever since learning to read and write at age 3, writing has been a very relaxing hobby for me. It allows me to express my thoughts and create entire
        worlds with a paper and pen. I also think my neat handwriting may motivate me a bit; seeing a page filled with words makes me <em>unreasonably</em> happy.

        <strong>Music</strong>
        I have a lot of hobbies that relate to music: playing instruments, listening to music, collecting CDs and vinyls... I seriously cannot live without it, as
        it's simultaneously so expressive and complex.

        <strong>Gaming</strong>
        I'm not too sure if this counts as a hobby; it's more of an <em>interest</em>, sure... But they're really good for passing the time and challenging myself. 
        My favorite series is the <em>Resident Evil series</em>, as it perfectly blends horror, puzzles, and action.

        <strong>Drawing</strong>
        I love drawing, especially making original characters! I love putting my own spin on my favorite characters too, and <em>adore</em> making posters, stickers, and flyers!
